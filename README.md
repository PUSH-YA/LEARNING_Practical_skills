# **Goal**

The main goal of this project is to learn all the practical skills associated with the process of model deployment from data collection from a  server to deploying your model using a docker.

# **What I learned**

## Dockers

These skills and understandings are also mentioned in my Dockers notes:
1. Container architecture
2. Docker commands
3. Docker storage
4. Docker networking
5. Docker compose
6. Docker version controlling with an external registry

> All of the skills above were learnt in both theoretical (at an introductory level) and applied manner

## Model deployment 

The skillsets I learnt:
- Host your own SQL Server 
- Loading and manipulating datasets on your SQL DB server using SSMS 
- Perform SQL queries using Python (Get access to data from SQL DB)
- Use `datasist` library to perform EDA and feature engineering
  
I also learned how to create API endpoints for my model using:
- `Flask`
- `Streamlit`

- Using `FastAPI` to create REST APIs for prediction
<center><img src = "Model deployment\mlfastpi_app.png" height = 500px></center>

Note: Also learned how to use `Git-LFS` because `sklearn.RandomForestRegression()` models have huge storage (_especially for trees with_ $\infty$ _depth_)
